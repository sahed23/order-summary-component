## My process ✍️
I create a main div inside body tag . then I take a child div and named it card.
```html
<div class="main" >
     
     <div class="card" >
              <!-- Card Designe -->
     </div>
</div>
```
Using Grid Template I responsibly place the card in center.
```css
 .main {
   display:grid;
   place-items:center;
 }
```
Then I create 5 separated Elements(Tag) inside the card to place items properly.
I take one img tag for placing top image , one h tag for card heading ,one p tag  for Summary message and  two div for price items and buttons individually.

After placing all content on their right place I start styling using pure CSS3 .

I use only Grid Template for placing items on right places .
